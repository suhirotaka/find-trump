# Find Trump!

Find Trump! is a chrome extension by which you can play hide-and-seek with the next US president Donald Trump.

Find Trump! randomly replaces an image in webpages to a Trump one. Players get a score when they find a Trump image then click it. You can customise how often such a replacing occurs from 0% to 90%. 

## Motivation
There are many applications which replaces Trump images to harmless ones (like kittens, etc.) What I want to do is getting balance back to the world. We must face reality for our future.

## Installation 
[Chrome Web Wtore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/find-trump/oebndenjcdmoaapiemjljobgaidblndm "Find Trump!")
